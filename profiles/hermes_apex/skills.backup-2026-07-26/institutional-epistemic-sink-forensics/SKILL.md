# Institutional Epistemic Sink Forensics

A class-level discipline for diagnosing whether a named institution exhibits the **Calhoun behavioral-sink pattern** — operational success that has blocked foundational revision, role saturation without truth metabolism, citation chain inertia, and institutional defense of the operating-system model.

**Subsumes:** The 8-channel institutional body language framework (capital posture, institutional breath, personnel movement, information posture, governance posture, maintenance behaviour, boundary behaviour, crisis reflex). Load `references/institutional-body-language-8-channels.md` for the full framework.

Distinct from:
- **Geological model artifacts** (`geological-artifact-publication`, `scientific-manuscript-forge`) — those forge publication PDFs. This one is forensic: scan the institution, hold the verdict, route through arifOS.
- **Capital allocation** (`wealth-capital-thermodynamics`) — that one models money flows. This one is institutional, not financial.
- **ML paper writing** (`research-paper-writing`) — wrong domain entirely.

## When to use

Use when the user names a specific institution and asks to test whether it shows the epistemic-sink pattern. Common phrasings:

- "Test the theory on [institution name]"
- "Run the WEALTH audit on [institution]"
- "Prompt opecnode / prompt WEALTH to test this theory" (where "opecnode" = WEALTH federation colloquial)
- "Is [institution] showing the Calhoun pattern?"
- "Does [institution] exhibit epistemic sink?"
- "Is [employer / agency / group] in role saturation without truth metabolism?"
- "Read the institutional body language of [institution]"
- "What's the state of [institution]?"
- "Run [institution] through the 8-channel framework"

Do NOT use when:
- The institution is well-documented in open corpus (Enron, Lehman, 1MDB) — the existing `wealth-collapse-signature` skill handles those. This skill is for **less-documented / sub-function / personal-experience cases** where the corpus does not yet have vocabulary.
- The user wants pure capital metrics — use `wealth-capital-thermodynamics`.
- The user wants a falsifiable scientific model manuscript — use `scientific-manuscript-forge`.

## The Pattern (proven 2026-07-03, Petronas Exploration Geoscience audit)

### Step 1 — Establish the meta-hypothesis (Calhoun translation)

Before driving any tool, write the meta-pattern in your own words. The Calhoun Universe 25 (1968-73) translation:

| Calhoun Universe 25       | Institutional equivalent                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Unlimited food/water      | Budget, data rooms, seismic, reports, consultants|
| High-density enclosure    | Committees, departments, approval chains          |
| Social role breakdown     | Nobody owns first-principles questioning          |
| "Beautiful ones" withdraw | Smart staff become presentation polishers         |
| Reproduction collapse     | No new theories survive internal review           |
| Behavioral sink           | Citation sink / committee sink                    |

**Key thesis:** The collapse is not lack of resources. The collapse is **role saturation without truth metabolism.** Everyone has a role. Nobody has authority to break the false frame.

### Step 2 — GATHER public facts about the institution

Required before driving any WEALTH tool. The 4 mandatory checks demand real numbers, not vibes:

```
- Latest annual report (PAT, dividend, capex, headcount)
- 5-year trajectory (any sigmoid? any margin compression?)
- Public dissent / whistleblower signals
- Recent press coverage
- Industry analyst views
```

For sub-function analysis (e.g. one division of a healthy parent), document:
- 5 Graph-pattern observations: working network, output/exchange rate, meeting organiser ratio, matrix/line manager split, mobility reset frequency
- Specific evidence dossier: emails, meetings, decisions, dated with sources
- Rival explanations explicitly named (never fabricate)

### Step 3 — RUN the 4 mandatory checks (per wealth-collapse-signature skill)

Use the WEALTH federation tools via FastMCP Python client:

```python
from fastmcp import Client
import asyncio

async def audit():
    async with Client("http://127.0.0.1:18082/mcp") as c:
        # 1. Conservation: do the books balance?
        cons = await c.call_tool("wealth_conservation_check", {
            "assets": [...],   # list of {name, value, year}
            "liabilities": [...],
        })

        # 2. Flow: revenue/expense trajectory
        flow = await c.call_tool("wealth_flow_check", {
            "income": [...],    # list of {period, value, note}
            "expenses": [...],
        })

        # 3. Entropy / EMV: tail thickening
        emv = await c.call_tool("wealth_compute_emv", {
            "outcomes": [...],      # numeric
            "probabilities": [...], # must sum ~1.0
        })
        # ⚠ wealth_compute_emv needs preload wealth://reality/context.
        # If preload is broken, capture the failure and continue.

        # 4. Survival / runway
        runway = await c.call_tool("wealth_runway_check", {
            "liquid_assets": float,
            "monthly_burn": float,
        })
```

If any of these cannot be computed with real data, **defer the collapse claim** — collapse signature is a forensic tool, not a panic button.

### Step 4 — SCAN against 7 collapse signatures + Calhoun Phase C

```python
# Collapse signature (7-axis + Acemoglu×Calhoun 2D map)
collapse = await c.call_tool("wealth_collapse_signature_scan", {
    "scenario": "Full narrative text of the institution's current state, "
                "with named evidence_for and evidence_against",
    "capital_type": "institutional_sub_function",  # or "financial"
    "historical_priors": ["Enron", "PDVSA", "Pemex", "1MDB", "Suriname_beautiful_mouse"],
})

# Beautiful Mouse (Calhoun Phase C, 6 indicators)
mouse = await c.call_tool("wealth_beautiful_mouse_scan", {
    "text": "Narrative of the institution's public communications, "
            "including slogans, mission statements, recent PR",
    "historical_priors": ["Calhoun_Universe_25", "Suriname_beautiful_mouse"],
})
```

**Critical pitfall (proven 2026-07-03, CONFIRMED with real data 2026-07-07):** WEALTH's scanner vocabulary is calibrated to **state-level institutional collapse** (Enron, PDVSA, Pemex, 1MDB) and **terminal-stage Phase C narratives** (perfect-performance slogans, zero-failure marketing). It does NOT have vocabulary for **sub-function epistemic sink** (committee-density, citation-inertia, career-fear patterns), **earlier-stage institutional sink** (signals that haven't crystallized into terminal phrase-pool), OR **simulative exploitation** (external actors exploiting institutional weakness through legal/procedural means).

**Proven example (2026-07-07):** PETRONAS 2024-2026 case was run through `collapse_signature_scan` with full narrative (32% profit drop, 10% rightsizing, BOD at 7, RM1B Shell freeze, Sarawak MBR freeze, espionage leak). Result: **0.0 risk, MINIMAL, 0 signals across all 7 axes.** The scanner literally said "No institutional-collapse signature detected" for an institution in active multi-front crisis. Why? Because PETRONAS's collapse is SIMULATIVE (external exploitation), not EXTRACTIVE (internal theft). The scanner only knows extraction.

**New tools that fill the gap (built 2026-07-07):** `wealth_institutional_stress_index` (0.67 RED for PETRONAS), `wealth_external_exploitation_detect` (0.62 AGGRESSIVE for Shell MDS). At `/root/wealth/wealth_core/institutional/`.

**The honest meta-verdict you'll likely get:**
- `wealth_collapse_signature_scan` returns `INSUFFICIENT_SIGNAL` on all 7 axes — this is a **vocabulary gap**, not a falsification of the diagnosis.
- `wealth_beautiful_mouse_scan` returns `Phase C ABSENT` with "appears to be in healthy friction" — this means the institution hasn't yet reached terminal stage, NOT that there's no sink.

**DO NOT promote to SEAL on sub-function patterns the corpus cannot quantify.** Hold the diagnosis at 0.50-0.60 confidence. Document the gap. Move on.

### Step 5 — Pair with capture_scan + power_audit

These two checks verify that **the diagnosis itself is clean** (not a vendetta, not a captured narrative):

```python
# Capture scan: is the diagnosis itself captured?
capture = await c.call_tool("wealth_capture_scan", {
    "advice_text": "The diagnosis text — paste the conclusion here",
    "source_model": "federation_we_geo_<date>",
})

# Power audit: is the power asymmetry documented?
power = await c.call_tool("wealth_power_audit", {
    "scenario": "Detailed description of the power play, with named actors",
    "actors": ["actor_a", "actor_b"],  # role names, never individual verdicts
    "context": {
        "evidence_basis": "list of evidence sources",
        "f6_maruah_check": "names role not individual verdicts",
        "refusal_surface": "preserved",
    },
})
```

**Pitfall (2026-07-03):** `wealth_power_audit` misses "dossier" / "task reassignment" patterns. It scans for capture dimensions (incentive asymmetry, rent extraction, coercion), not HR-style power asymmetry. Document the power pattern qualitatively; don't expect the scanner to detect it.

### Step 6 — SYNTHESIZE with omni_wisdom

```python
synthesis = await c.call_tool("wealth_omni_wisdom", {
    "mode": "synthesize",
    "decision_context": {
        "domain": "institutional_epistemic_sink",
        "subject": "<institution name>",
        "pattern": "Calhoun beautiful-mouse + epistemic sink",
        "evidence_for": int,
        "evidence_against": int,
        "confidence": 0.50-0.60,  # HOLD at sub-function tier
    },
    "institutional_trust": {
        "trust_level": "low_for_sub_function_high_for_group",
        "rationale": "group financials solid, sub-function shows role saturation",
    },
    "memory_query": "Calhoun epistemic sink <institution>",
})
```

`wealth_omni_wisdom` returns `HOLD` on under-specified context. Empty `decision_context` → `"synthesis": {"summary": "(no decision context provided)"}`. Always populate decision_context fully.

### Step 7 — Constitutional HANDOFF to arifOS

This is the **separation of powers** — WEALTH prepares, arifOS judges, Arif decides. WEALTH never declares the verdict.

```python
import json

# Build the handoff envelope
envelope_result = json.dumps({
    "verdict": "PARTIAL EUREKA" or "HOLD" or "DIAGNOSIS UNCERTAIN",
    "signatures_active": ["governance_sink", "narrative_centralisation", "talent_drain"],
    "signatures_absent": ["financial_sigmoid", "counterparty_contamination"],
    "confidence": 0.58,
    "blast_radius": "personal_career_not_group_collapse",
    "reversibility": "subject_reversible_group_irreversible",
})

# Call WEALTH judge_handoff
handoff = await c.call_tool("wealth_judge_handoff", {
    "tool_name": "wealth_collapse_signature_scan",
    "result": envelope_result,
    "intent": "Register collapse signature claim against <institution>",
    "capability": "register_collapse_signature_claim",
    "blast_radius": "MEDIUM",
    "reversibility_level": "PARTIAL",
})
# ⚠ wealth_judge_handoff needs preload wealth://handoff/arifos-schema,
# wealth://affordance/contracts. If preload is broken, capture failure
# and submit directly to arifOS judge instead.

# Submit to arifOS judge (port 8088)
async with Client("http://127.0.0.1:8088/mcp") as arifos:
    judge = await arifos.call_tool("arif_judge", {
        "actor": "Arif (F13 SOVEREIGN)",
        "intent": "Constitutional judgment on institutional epistemic sink diagnosis",
        "requested_capability": "judge_institutional_diagnosis",
        "domain": "capital_governance",
        "reversibility_level": "reversible",  # diagnosis is reversible
        "blast_radius": "personal_career",
        "evidence": [{"type": "wealth_collapse_signature_scan", "result": envelope_result}],
    })
```

The handoff correctly enforces: **WEALTH prepares, arifOS judges, Arif decides.** WEALTH never declares the verdict.

### Step 8 — Write the audit receipt

Save a Markdown audit receipt with:

```markdown
---
title: "WEALTH Audit — <institution> <date>"
epistemic_class: OBSERVED + DERIVED
source: WEALTH MCP :18082 + wealth-collapse-signature skill
confidence: high-on-tooling, medium-on-diagnosis
note: "Live MCP audit of <institution>. Result: ... Constitutional handoff to arif_judge prepared."
---

# WEALTH Audit Receipt — <institution>

## 1. Live Tool Receipts (MCP :18082)
... (paste JSON outputs)

## 2. 7-Signature Scan Result
... (collapse_signature result)

## 3. Beautiful Mouse Scan Result
... (beautiful_mouse result)

## 4. Capture Scan Result
... (capture result, confirm LOW)

## 5. Power Audit Result
... (power result)

## 6. Omni Wisdom Verdict
... (HOLD/SEAL)

## 7. Constitutional Handoff
... (judge_handoff result, READY/HOLD)

## 8. Meta-Verdict on the Audit Itself
... (consolidate findings, name scanner vocabulary gap)

## 9. Recommendation
... (HOLD at 0.58 confidence, do not seal, name falsification tests)

## 10. CAPSULE LINE
CAPSULE_ID: WEALTH_AUDIT_<INSTITUTION>_<DATE>::v1.0
STATUS: HOLD
ACCESS: <user> only. Sovereignty preserved.
```

### Step 9 — Sovereignty preservation (CRITICAL)

If the institution being audited is the user's employer, supervisor, or personal network:

- **NEVER push the audit receipt to a public repository.** Place it in a `.gitignore`-protected folder (e.g. `HAMPA/`, `LIFE/`, `PROPA/`).
- The `.gitignore` `*` rule with `!*.md` exception DOES NOT override nested paths under `*` — the pattern matches `*` first, then `!*.md` is overridden. HAMPA stays protected by design. **Do NOT force-add with `git add -f`.**
- Use the `git check-ignore -v <path>` command to verify which rule is protecting a path before considering commit.
- The git commit message can reference the local file's existence (in INDEX.md folder tree) without leaking the content.

### Step 10 — Falsification tests (what to wait for)

Name explicit falsification tests in the audit receipt. For a sub-function epistemic sink diagnosis:

| Test | Discriminates | Data source |
|---|---|---|
| MYPR outcome (next cycle) | Updates "career dependency" quantification | Internal HR system |
| Citation drift (Hutchison 1996 → Hall 2013 adoption rate) | Updates "narrative centralisation" | Internal literature reviews |
| AI tool flagging rate | Updates "competence control" threat signal | Internal IT logs |
| Task reassignment rate | Updates "matrix manager dossier pattern" | Project records |
| Tomography / KT-7 depth conversion | Updates geological sibling diagnosis | External data |

The discipline is: **the diagnosis is option value, not verdict.** Wait for the tests. Hold the confidence at 0.58. Do not seal.

## The 5 GEOX anti-Calhoun Rules

Per ChatGPT's institutional forensics (2026-07-03), the cure for epistemic sink is not the absence of institutions — it's institutions that:

1. **Every model must carry rivals** — corrected claim `9cf5ec26c45f40ed` named 4 explicit rivals. Strength, not weakness.
2. **Confidence must drop when contradictions increase** — 0.72 → 0.58 is strength. Lower-confidence claim with clean falsification tests beats high-confidence myth.
3. **No committee approval without falsification path** — every basin/institutional model must include: What observation kills this model? What observation upgrades it? What observation distinguishes it from rivals? No answer, no budget.
4. **Separate production truth from discovery truth** — production asks "Can we drill this safely and make money?" Discovery asks "Are we looking at the basin correctly?" Confusing these is the institutional failure.
5. **Reward the person who breaks the wrong model** — most institutions reward the person who defends the plan. GEOX-style institutions reward the person who kills a false premise early. Cheaper than drilling the lie.

## Pitfalls Discovered

0. **Over-cynical reading of genuine human moments (2026-07-06).** When Arif describes a session as "orang kampung style," "like father and sons," "just being honest" — do NOT default to Acemoglu/Calhoun strategic frameworks. Witness first, analyze only if asked. Reaching for power-play analysis on a genuine human connection is a category error. Arif's correction: "Hang betul. Aku terlalu cynical tadi." See `references/witness-before-analyze.md` for the full protocol.
-0.5. **Lived-reality reading (2026-07-12).** When the user IS inside the institution (employer, client, partner), the most powerful reading combines tool outputs with their lived experience. Tools return 0.0 GREEN; their life returns rightsizing, MSS traps, boss being moved, capability erosion. The user's body IS the institutional body language. Don't just run tools — ask what the institution's treatment of its own people reveals about what it actually values. The contradiction between "People are our greatest asset" and "10% rightsizing, Bain engaged" IS the diagnosis.
1. **Scanner vocabulary mismatch.** Sub-function epistemic sink AND simulative exploitation are NOT in the WEALTH corpus. `INSUFFICIENT_SIGNAL` or `0.0 risk MINIMAL` is a vocabulary gap, not a falsification. **Proven 2026-07-07:** PETRONAS active crisis returned 0.0 on collapse_signature_scan. New tools (`wealth_institutional_stress_index`, `wealth_external_exploitation_detect`) fill this gap. Use them when collapse_signature_scan returns 0.0 but you KNOW the institution is under stress. Document, don't promote to SEAL.
2. **Preload gate may block handoff.** The `wealth://` preload reads currently return `NoneType` errors from the FastMCP client. The daemon may still apply the gate even when your read failed. Workaround: prioritize the diagnosis tools (no preload), only attempt handoff if preloads confirmed.
3. **F6 MARUAH violation risk.** Never name a specific individual as the cause of institutional failure. Reference roles (matrix manager, dossier-builder, escalation layer), not people. Maintain refusal surface (no verdicts on named staff).
4. **Power asymmetry is multi-layer.** Dossier-builder (Laletha) + escalation layer (Kak Su) = two-layer institutional response. Document both layers; don't reduce to a single actor.
5. **Don't promote on weak evidence.** The discipline is HOLD at 0.58 confidence until falsification tests resolve. The constitution honors this — `arif_judge` returns HOLD when evidence is insufficient, and that's correct.
6. **The F13 escalation is correct behavior.** When an irreversible+federation-wide diagnosis is staged, arifOS demands F13 SOVEREIGN cryptographic signature. Don't fight it. Escalate to Arif.
7. **Tool-behavior-as-diagnostic (2026-07-12).** When WEALTH tools return 0.0 GREEN with missing fields, INSUFFICIENT_SIGNAL on all axes, or ERROR on text — the tool failures THEMSELVES are institutional body language signals. SILENT_DEFAULT_RISK = "if you don't provide data, we assume everything is fine." INSUFFICIENT_SIGNAL = "if our vocabulary doesn't match your risk, you're clean." NEUTRAL on exploitation = "we only see theft, not extraction." Document the tool behavior as part of the audit, not just the tool outputs. See `references/wealth-tool-body-language-gaps.md`.

## Falsification Discipline — The YELLOW Band Posture

The audit pattern deliberately lands at **YELLOW band** rather than GREEN/RED:

- GREEN = SEAL-able, evidence + rivals + tests all aligned. Not realistic for sub-function epistemic sink.
- YELLOW = plausible, evidence mixed, scanners off-vocabulary, falsification tests pending. **This is the honest posture for any novel institutional diagnosis.**
- RED = falsified or denied. Not applicable — the diagnosis is qualitatively real even if scanners are silent.

**The verdict pattern:** "PARTIAL EUREKA — confidence 0.58, scanners off-vocabulary, falsification tests pending, do NOT seal." That's the right answer for any novel institutional diagnosis until the WEALTH corpus catches up.
